# Pyano
![Pyano](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FracturedRocketSpace/RockBand/master/Pyano.jpg)
## Instructions
Main.py will start the pyano. Some settings can be changed in config.py

## Notes
A lot of processing power is needed to simulate the pyano in real time! The samplerate (Fs) or the spatial steps might have to be turned down in config.py for real time play.
